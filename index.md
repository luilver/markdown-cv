## Experience

### Senior Data Engineer • _MX Technologies, Lehi, UT_ • May 2021 – Present
- Designed and maintained **Luigi-based pipelines** for processing streaming and batch data (daily volumes ~100GB).
- Built transformations in **pandas** to normalize, clean, and aggregate raw data for analytics tables.
- Automated task orchestration, dependency management, and alerting.
- Developed and optimized queries in **Google BigQuery**, achieving 30% faster performance and reduced costs by 20%.
- Used **SQLAlchemy** for seamless interactions with PostgreSQL and BigQuery via Python scripts with robust retry logic and connection pooling.

### Data Engineer • _PrintAI Innovations, Boulder, CO_ • Jun 2019 – Jun 2021
- Implemented ETL workflows using **pandas**, SQLAlchemy, and custom scripts to populate data warehouse and ML-ready datasets.
- Set up initial **Redshift** environment: schemas, partitioned tables, access controls, and cost monitoring.
- Collaborated with data scientists and analysts, delivering standardized datasets and reusable transformation libraries.

## Education

**B.S. in Computer Science**  
University of Havana — 2008

## Projects

### End-to-end Analytics Pipeline
- Built an **ETL pipeline** using Luigi that orchestrated data ingestion from APIs → staging in GCS → cleaning with pandas → loading to BigQuery.
- Implemented error handling, retries, and task visualization via Luigi UI.

### Query Performance Optimization
- Refactored slow-performing BigQuery SQL using partitioning, clustering, and materialized views.
- Reduced query execution time by 40% and cost per query by 25%.

### DB API Abstraction Layer
- Developed a Python library using **SQLAlchemy** to abstract database operations, supporting multiple backends (PostgreSQL, BigQuery).
- Features included connection pooling, migrations, transaction support, and type-safe model definitions.
